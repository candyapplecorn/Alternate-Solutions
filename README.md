# Candy's-Solutions
Code Golf

I won't be following App Academy's style recommendations, nor will I be solving problems using just what's been covered in Bootcamp Prep. In fact, I'll be using [Ecmascript 6](http://es6-features.org/#ExpressionBodies), which technically isn't Javascript ([__yet__](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_6_support_in_Mozilla)).

I'm far from the best programmer around, and look forward to seeing better solutions than these!

## Extra Problems
For the students who want more than the bonus problems, here you go. For any of these terms, do some google-fu to figure out what the term is, and then implement it in Javascript. Try not to look at solutions before creating your own! 

### Weeks 2 & 3
_Students should be educated enough to attempt these problems by, or by the end of, week2._

* Binary Search
* Reverse an array without array.push, array.reverse, or array.unshift
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Ultra Mega Hard Mode: Quicksort
* Ultra Mega Super Giga Hard Mode: Quicksort __with optimizations__

### Weekless
Students should be able to implement these data structures by week 3:
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Search Tree
* Infernal mode: Circularly-Linked List (aka Doubly-Linked List)
